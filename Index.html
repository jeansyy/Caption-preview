  <h1>A Better You – Healthy Ways to Avoid Microplastics</h1>
  <p><strong>Microplastics are tiny plastic bits in your water, food, and even your bloodstream.</strong></p>

  <h2>1. Choose Tap Water Over Bottled</h2>
  <p>Filtered tap water usually contains fewer microplastics than bottled. Skip the plastic when you can.</p>

  <h2>2. Don’t Heat Food in Plastic</h2>
  <p>Heating plastic containers releases microplastics into your food. Use glass or ceramic instead.</p>

  <h2>3. Cut Down on Processed Foods</h2>
  <p>Heavily processed foods can contain higher levels of plastic. Cooking whole foods helps reduce exposure.</p>

  <h2>4. Watch Packaging</h2>
  <p>Plastics and painted bottle caps can shed particles. Go for glass jars, paper packaging, and fresh produce.</p>

  <h2>5. Wear Natural Fibers</h2>
  <p>Polyester and nylon shed microfibers when washed. Switch to cotton, hemp, or wool when you can.</p>

  <p><strong>Small changes = big impact.</strong> A better you starts with fewer plastics.</p>
